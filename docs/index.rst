Documentation starter pack
==========================

The documentation starter pack helps you to quickly set up, build, and publish documentation with Sphinx.

It contains common styling and configuration through the `Canonical Sphinx`_ extension, supports both |RST| and Markdown, and includes automatic documentation checks.
