.. _makefile:

Integrate the Makefiles
=======================

The :file:`doc/` directory contains a dedicated :file:`Makefile`
that implements the targets provided by the starter pack.
You should keep it up-to-date with recent changes to the starter pack;
therefore, avoid doing updates to the file.
If you need updates,
consider contributing them to the upstream starter pack repository instead.
