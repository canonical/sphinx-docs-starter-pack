Initial setup
=============

This section is intended for repository administrators.
It shows how to initially set up your documentation using the starter pack.
After this is done, documentation contributors can follow the instructions in :ref:`update`.

.. important::
   After setting up your repository with the starter pack, you should track the changes made to the starter pack.

   Changes to the look and feel, as well as common functionality, will be automatically available through updates to the `Canonical Sphinx`_ extension.

   Changes to files that are part of the starter pack, for example, :ref:`automatic-checks`, might require you to manually update your repository with the required files.
   See the starter pack's `change log`_ for the most relevant (and of course all breaking) changes.
