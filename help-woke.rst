Inclusive language check exemptions
===================================

This page provides an overview of two inclusive language check exemption
methods for files written in reST format. See the `woke documentation`_ for
full coverage.

Exempt a word
-------------

To exempt an individual word, place a custom ``none`` role (defined in the
``canonical-sphinx-extensions`` Sphinx extension) anywhere on the line
containing the word in question. The role syntax is:

.. code-block:: none

   :none:`wokeignore:rule=<SOME_WORD>,`

For instance:

.. code-block:: none

   This is your text. The word in question is here: whitelist. More text. :none:`wokeignore:rule=whitelist,`

To exempt an element of a URL, it is recommended to use the standard reST
method of placing links at the bottom of the page (or in a separate file). In
this case, a comment line is placed immediately above the URL line. The comment
syntax is:

.. code-block:: none

   .. wokeignore:rule=<SOME_WORD>

Here is an example where a URL element contains the string "master": :none:`wokeignore:rule=master,`

.. code-block:: none

   .. LINKS
   .. wokeignore:rule=master
   .. _link definition: https://some-external-site.io/master/some-page.html

You can now refer to the label ``link definition_`` in the body of the text.

Exempt an entire file
---------------------

A more drastic solution is to make an exemption for the contents of an entire
file. For example, to exempt file ``docs/foo/bar.rst`` add the following line
to file ``.wokeignore``:

.. code-block:: none

   foo/bar.rst

.. LINKS
.. _woke documentation: https://docs.getwoke.tech/ignore
