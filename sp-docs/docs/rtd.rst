Set up Read the Docs
====================

For Canonical-specific information on how to set up your documentation on Read the Docs, see the `Read the Docs at Canonical <https://library.canonical.com/documentation/read-the-docs>`_ and `How to publish documentation on Read the Docs <https://library.canonical.com/documentation/publish-on-read-the-docs>`_ guides.

In general, after enabling the starter pack for your documentation, follow these steps to build and publish your documentation on Read the Docs:

1. Make sure your documentation :ref:`builds without errors or warnings <build-clean>`.
#. Log into Read the Docs.
#. Use the `manual import`_ to create a project.
#. If your documentation is not on the root level but in a documentation folder, you must specify the path to the :file:`.readthedocs.yaml` file for your build.
   You do this by navigating to :guilabel:`Admin` > :guilabel:`Settings` and specifying the path under "Path for ``.readthedocs.yaml``".

After this initial setup, your documentation should build successfully.
If you get any errors, check the build log for indications on what the problem is.

Configure the webhook
---------------------

If you have administrator privileges for the GitHub repository that you are adding, the integration webhook (which is responsible for automatically building the documentation when the repository changes) is created automatically.

If you don't have administrator privileges, the webhook must be set up by someone who does.
See `How to manually configure a Git repository integration`_ if you want to set it up manually.

Make your documentation public
------------------------------

By default, Read the Docs publishes your documentation for logged-in users only.

To make the documentation public, you must configure the privacy level for each version of the documentation separately.
You can do this by navigating to the :guilabel:`Versions` tab and changing the :guilabel:`Privacy Level` for each version.

Enable PR previews
------------------

To make Read the Docs automatically build your documentation when a pull request is opened or updated on GitHub, enable PR reviews for your project.

To do so, navigate to :guilabel:`Admin` > :guilabel:`Settings` and select :guilabel:`Build pull requests for this project`.

Read the Docs will then automatically build the documentation for each pull request, and the link to the output will be available as one of the checks in the pull request.
