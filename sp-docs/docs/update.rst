Update the documentation
========================

This section is intended for documentation contributors and covers how to work with the documentation after the repository has been set up with the starter pack as described in :ref:`enable`.

You'll find information on how to build and preview the documentation, and some pointers on what you need to know about the documentation framework and where to get help with it.
